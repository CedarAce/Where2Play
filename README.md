 Subscription game finding directory website

I made this website to help folks who have Playstation Plus and/or Xbox Gamepass subscription to find new games and search for games they want to play. The data is sourced from the great Reddit community /r/PlaystationPlus and /r/XboxGamePass. Using the RAWG API to get image art and game description. 

The website is live at https://where2play.com
